            To be sure, sales of EVs remain a sliver of the overall auto industry, representing only about 2% market 
            share in 2020, according to Cox Automotive, which owns 
            <a class="link-decoration" href="https://www.kbb.com">

            is expected to double to 4% in 2021, Cox executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            She cautioned that automakers' commitments to switch to electric vehicles can be "squishy" – that is, 
            susceptible to change down the road if sales don't go so well.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            "We have to keep in mind these are intentions," Krebs said. "There are things that can get in the way

            There are still plenty of signs that the gas engine isn't going anywhere anytime soon, including 
            lingering concerns about electric vehicle battery range, cost and the availability of public car chargers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            But interest in EVs is picking up. Some 52% of car owners say they probably or definitely will own an 
            electric vehicle within the next 10 years, up from 34% in 2018,according to survey data provided to USA
             TODAY in advance of its broader publication by car-buying site CarGurus.

            What factors will decide the pace of the EV revolution? Here's what to watch for:
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-font">
            How quickly will electric vehicle prices come down?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            This may be the most important factor. While automakers have reduced the cost of battery development,
             it remains the main reason why electric cars have higher price tags than gas cars: often in the high 
             five-figure range.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            The Tesla Model S sedan and Model X SUV can easily top $100,000. Lucid's new vehicles will also easily
             go into six-figure territory.
        </p>
        <img class="advertisement-text-margin" src="img/advertisement2.png"alt="Advertisement">
        <p class="text-font">
            Tesla's most affordable vehicle is the Model 3 compact car. While the price has changed several times, 
            it's generally hard to get for less than $40,000.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            But even electric cars from non-luxury brands are still fetching a premium over comparable gasoline 
            vehicles. The Chevrolet Bolt electric car starts at about $36,500, which is about $10,000 more than 
            similarly sized gas vehicles from mainstream brands.

            Can maintenance and fuel savings make up the difference?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            
            While prices remain high, advocates of electric cars say they often make up for it by saving owners
             money on gas and maintenance. Electric vehicles have fewer parts, don't use much or any gas and don't
              require oil changes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            Owning a compact electric car costs an average of about $600 more than owning a gas car, according to AAA,
             though the cost varies considerably depending on electricity prices and usage.

            Joel Spurlock, a Salina, Kansas, resident, and his family own a Chevrolet Volt semi-electric vehicle and a
             Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid. Both of his vehicles can travel dozens of miles on electricity before 
             using gas.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            But in 2020, when the pandemic was limiting travel opportunities, Spurlock said he drove 11,000 miles in
             his Volt without using a drop of gasoline. He also loves the instant propulsion that you get from an 
             electric vehicle.

            Will there be enough electric vehicle chargers?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            The single most influential factor that would convince Americans to buy an electric vehicle is the 
            availability of charging stations in their area, according to the CarGurus study.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            The "real-world limitations" of EVs, including limited range and the need to strategically plan out a route
             ahead of time on longer trips, are significant drawbacks, said Tom Ryan, an attorney who lives in Union
              County, New Jersey, and works in Manhattan.

            Ryan said he remains "a little skeptical" about EVs. His family is currently considering replacing their 
            gas-powered Honda Civic and Volvo XC70, but he doesn't think an EV is practical for their lifestyle at 
            this point.

            "There's a lot of planning that’s involved in that, and I don’t think the infrastructure is there yet,

            Will automakers make the kind of EVs that Americans want?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            Gas-powered cars have been falling out of favor for years, with automakers discontinuing vehicles like 
            the Honda Fit, Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus. In their place are SUVs like the Honda Passport, 
            Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Bronco.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            Yet very few automakers are offering electric SUVs. Most are still cars.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            The CarGurus study showed that "electric SUVs and crossovers are most likely to be considered (by shoppers)
            , but few of them are available on the market today," said Madison Gross, director of consumer insights at 
            CarGurus.    
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            The few include crossovers like the Tesla Model Y and the Hyundai Kona EV. But more are coming, including
             a GMC Hummer SUV, the Rivian R1S and the Ford Mustang Mach-E.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            Today, the three most popular vehicles in America are gas-powered pickups made by Ford, Chevrolet and Ram.
             But electric pickups are on their way, too, including the Tesla Cybertruck, an electric Ford F-150 and the
              GMC Hummer pickup.

            Will electric car tax incentives help?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            A long-established federal tax incentive for electric vehicles is worth up to $7,500, but it can no longer
             be used to purchase vehicles made by Tesla or GM since they've surpassed their caps.

            But multiple bills introduced by Democrats in Congress since President Joe Biden took office would raise 
            the limits, providing additional incentives that could supercharge the market for EVs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            "Under the new administration and in light of the new U.S. Congressional makeup, we think federal 
            legislation will be passed that will benefit EVs," CFRA Research stock analyst Garrett Nelson said in a 
            research note.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            "While it is too early to predict what form this legislation might take, green energy and electric vehicles
             were one of the centerpieces of President Biden’s campaign platform, as he proposed new tax incentives, 
             government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs."

            <span class="font-black">Can EV startups compete?</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            In recent years, several electric vehicle startups have begun making big promises. Among them are:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul-font">
            <li>
                Lucid, which is led by CEO Peter Rawlinson, a former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S. Lucid has
                    <a class="link-decoration" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/09/09/lucid-air-lucid-motors-electric-car/5748925002/">
                        pledged to deliver the Lucid Air electric sedan in 2021
                    </a>
                , with one option starting at $139,000 and providing more than 500 miles per charge, an industry high.
                The company is poised to go public later this year, and is valued at $24 billion.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-font">
             In an interview, Rawlinson said Lucid's technology is "world-class" and capable of competing with the 
             best in the business, which, he said, is currently his former employer Tesla.
        </p>
        <ul class="text-ul-font">
            <li>
                Rivian, which is poised to begin selling an electric SUV and electric pickup later this year. The 
                company, which has fetched investments from the likes of Ford and Amazon, has raised $8 billion since
                 2019.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-font">
            Rivian, which will manufacture its initial vehicles at a former Mitsubishi plant in Illinois, is expected 
            to pursue an IPO valuing it at $50 billion later this year,

                according to Bloomberg.

        <ul class="text-ul-font">
            <li>
                Fisker, Lordstown and Bollinger. All three of these startups are also promising glistening new 
                built-from-scratch electric vehicles in the coming years.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-font">
            Are electric car investors too exuberant?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-font">
            Investor interest in EVs soared in early 2021 as they sought to capitalize on the future of transportation.
             Tesla's shares briefly topped $900, up three-fold since September, before falling back below $700 in 
             recent weeks. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said in an interview that investor interest in electric vehicle companies may 
            have gone "a bit over the top."
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            But "I think it shows that the financial sector and investors are really believing the car market will 
            be electric," Samuelsson said. "So I think it's encouraging."
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            With Lucid valued so higlink-decorationy despite never selling a single car, industry observers are watching closely 
            to see whether the company delivers on its promises, including a groundbreaking combination of electric 
            motors and inverter technology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            The Lucid Air's arrival was recently delayed from the first half of 2021 to the second half, but Rawlinson
             said that delay was due to quality issues caused by COVID-19-related delays at suppliers. He argued that 
             Lucid's vehicles would exemplify the essence of quality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            "We've got the capital. This is a one-shot deal to make a real high-quality product," he said.
        </p>
        <p class="text-font">
            Lucid, he said, will not make the same mistakes that Tesla made in the early going on the assembly of the
             Model 3 when CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that the company invested too much in automated equipment.
        </p>

        <p class="text-font">
            "We've got a much more manual approach to a general assembly line where we put the car together," 
            Rawlinson said. "I think that was one of the pitfalls (for Tesla). And we believe in the value of human
             dexterity for lots of reasons."
